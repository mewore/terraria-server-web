# terraria-server-web

A web UI for Terraria server management.

## TODO

### MVP

- [x] ğŸ’™ğŸ’œğŸ’› Minimal project with basic authentication
- [x] ğŸ’™ Hosts register their state in the database
- [x] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Host summary (on the front page)
- [x] ğŸ’™ Ability to fetch the current TModLoader versions from
  the [releases](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/releases/) of the tModLoader GitHub project
- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Ability to tell the host to download a Terraria dedicated server executable
  from [the Terraria wiki](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Server#Downloads) and a TModLoader and combine them into a
  single directory.
- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Display the Terraria worlds of a host
- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Display the Terraria instances of a host
- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Ability to start and stop Terraria (one running instance per host) with a specific world. A process uses
  files as input/output and in the code and the database, it is represented as a state machine. It keeps track of its
  state and at which position it is in the input and output files. Alternatively, use `tmux`. That wouldn't be a
  cross-platform solution, but it would be much easier to implement.

### Basic features

- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Ability to configure the Terraria executable path of a host ("${HOME}/.local/share/Terraria/{Instances |
  Executables}" by default) and to view what is present
- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Ability to upload Terraria worlds
- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Display the Terraria mods of a host
- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Ability to upload Terraria mods

### Advanced features

- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Ability to download Terraria worlds
- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Ability to duplicate and rename Terraria worlds
- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Ability to download Terraria mods
- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Ability to start multiple Terraria instances per host (every host has a quota). Different instances cannot
  use the same world.
- [ ] ğŸ’™ğŸ’› Ability to use the tModLoader mod browser
- [ ] (Unrelated) Flyway migration tests with Docker

### Expert features

- [ ] (Unrelated) Flyway migration undo tests
